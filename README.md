# Depth-Estimation

Depth estimation is a crucial step towards inferring scene geometry from 2D images. The goal in my project is to predict the depth value of each pixel or inferring depth information, given only a single RGB image as input. In other words, it is the process of estimating the distance of objects in a scene from a single camera viewpoint.

Monocular depth estimation has various applications, including 3D reconstruction, augmented reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. It is a challenging task as it requires the model to understand the complex relationships between objects in the scene and the corresponding depth information, which can be affected by factors such as lighting conditions, occlusion, and texture.
